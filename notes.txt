--> When ever a user modifies the properties of your cell 
then you should do 2 way binding. 

--> It means bring all the data changes into the storage i.e. making chages
 to the properties of the cell and making those reflect in the UI.

--> Example : If you click on the A2 cell then all the properties of it should be displayed, like if 
 it is bold then the bold symbol should be shown active and letters should be bold.And other properties 
 will have default property because they dont have any effect on this cell.

Formula Bar notes :-
--> Event listeners used:focus, blur
       -> blur works first before click.
--> Formula evaluation:
       -> Normal expression   eg:(10+20)  
       -> Dependency expression  eg:(A1+A2+10)
